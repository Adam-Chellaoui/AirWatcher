# AirWatcher

## 1. Intro

AirWatcher is an application that aims to process data from air quality sensors. First of all, it gathers the data from different sensors and makes them available to the public. In addition to that, it groups similar data from sensors at a certain point in time to form geographical air quality zones.


Thus, thanks to this information, it will be possible to know the air quality at a geographical position without sensors, knowing the data of the nearest zone. The idea is to be able to inform the general public about the air quality in most of the United States for the purpose of prevention for all kinds of companies.


## 2. Details

Some particular companies will have the right to an additional service thanks to AirWatcher. Indeed, producers of air purifiers would like to know the impact of their products on the localities where they are located. The aim of the application is therefore to show the evolution of the air quality in the surroundings of these air purifiers and to know their range when they are in operation.


AirWatcher's data is also based on sensors installed by individuals in their homes. For each measurement used by the application on their sensor, the individual receives a point that can be converted into a benefit set by the government.


Without multiplying the sources of information, this method can also allow more or less well-intentioned people to err on the data of their sensor. Air Watcher is therefore responsible for detecting sensors providing incorrect measurements and then marking all user data as false and therefore unusable in the geographic representation.
